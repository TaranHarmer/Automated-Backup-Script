## Prerequisites

Before using the Automatic Backup Script, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- A system where you can run shell scripts.
- Basic knowledge of shell commands.
- Sufficient storage space for storing backups.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Automatic-Backup-Script.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Automatic-Backup-Script
   ```

4. Ensure that the shell script is executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x backup.sh
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the **'backup.sh'** script and configure the following settings as needed:
- Specify the source directories and files you want to back up.
- Define the destination directory where backup archives will be stored.
- Set backup retention policies, such as the number of backups to keep and the maximum age of backups.

2. Run the script to create a backup:

   ```bash
   ./backup.sh
   ```

3. The program will automatically create a backup archive of your specified files and directories.

4. The backup archive will be stored in the destination directory.

## Configuration

In the **'backup.sh'** script, you can customize the following settings:
- **Source Directories**: Define the directories and files to be included in the backup.
- **Destination Directory**: Specify the directory where backup archives will be saved.
- **Backup Retention**: Set the number of backup versions to keep and the maximum age of backups. Older backups will be automatically removed based on these settings.
- **Data Compression**: Choose the compression method (e.g., tar and gzip) to reduce backup archive size.

## Scheduling

To automate the backup process on a regular basis, you can use cron jobs on Linux. Here's an example of scheduling daily backups at midnight:

   ```bash
   # Schedule a daily backup at midnight
   0 0 * * * /path/to/backup.sh-
   ```

Customize the cron job based on your preferred backup schedule.
